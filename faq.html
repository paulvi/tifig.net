    <div class='faq-question'>Is Tifig open source?</div>
    <div class='faq-answer'>
      Not yet. Tifig is part of my master thesis and I can't open source it until that project is done.
      However, it is my goal to make it available as open source in early 2017. Meanwhile, I plan to
      release a new alpha version of Tifig every two or three weeks.

    <div class='faq-question'>Which versions of Swift are supported?</div>
    <div class='faq-answer'>
      Tifig requires at least Swift 3.0, which is expected to be released in late 2016 and will bring
      <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution#implemented-proposals-for-swift-3">a lot of changes</a>
      to the language. It is also the first release to include the <a href="https://swift.org/package-manager/">Swift Package Manager</a>,
      which Tifig uses to build programs.
