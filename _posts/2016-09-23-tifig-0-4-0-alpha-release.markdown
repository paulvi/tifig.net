    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div class="release-note-title">Indexer Improvements</div>
    <div class="release-note-body">
		The indexer can now handle extension declarations and module imports and should be updated automatically when new
		files are added or existing files are removed. However, the indexer is still a work in progress and there is a lot
		of work to be done in this area.
    </div>
  </li>

  <li>
    <div class="release-note-title">Launcher</div>
    <div class="release-note-body">
		The indexer now automatically recognizes the modules of your project. To run a project, it must
		contain at least one executable module (module that contains a <code>main.swift</code> file). If there are
		multiple executable modules, Tifig will present a dialog that lets you select the module you would
		like to run. Additionally, when you edit a Run Configuration, you can change the module to be executed.
    </div>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <div class="release-note-title">Other Changes</div>
    <div class="release-note-body">
		The macOS version of Tifig is now signed, which means that there should be no Gatekeeper warnings anymore when you launch Tifig.
    </div>
  </li>
</ul>

As always, you can download the latest version of Tifig from the [Download page](/download/).
