Mac users can now install Tifig using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). In order to install the current
version, execute the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
brew update
brew cask install tifig
```

I will release a new version of Tifig next week. However, it will only be a minor release as I am
currently busy writing the documentation for my term project.
