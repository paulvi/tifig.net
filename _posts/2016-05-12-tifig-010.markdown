Today, I am happy to release the first alpha version of Tifig, a new Eclipse-based IDE for [Swift](https://swift.org/).
It is still at a very early stage of development, but it is already possible to write, build and run
simple Swift programs.

My main goal for Tifig is for it to become a solid, extendable, cross-platform Swift IDE with good
refactoring tools. Since Xcode is heavily focused on the development of iOS and Mac apps, Tifig may
primarly appeal to web developers who want to use Swift on the server.

I am working on Tifig as part of my master thesis at [HSR](http://www.hsr.ch) and I also have a part-time job
at the [Institute for Software](http://ifs.hsr.ch/), where we create [Cevelop](https://www.cevelop.com) among other things.

You are welcome to <a href="/download/">download Tifig</a> and try it on your system. If you have any suggestions
or bug reports, you can send me an <a href="mailto:tonisuter@me.com">email</a> or a DM on <a href="https://twitter.com/tonisuter">Twitter</a>.
Any feedback is highly appreciated. Please keep in mind however, that a lot of essential features are still missing or incomplete.
