title:  "Tifig 0.1.0 - An Eclipse-based IDE for Swift "

Today, I am pleased to release the first alpha version of Tifig, a new Eclipse-based IDE for [Swift](https://swift.org/).
It is still at a very early stage of development, but it is already possible to write, build and run
simple Swift programs.

To build programs, Tifig uses the [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/), which is still in development
and is expected to be released along with Swift 3.0 in late 2016. Therefore, Tifig currently requires the installation of a
recent [development snapshot](https://swift.org/download/#snapshots) that contains the Swift Package Manager.

My main goal for Tifig is for it to become a solid, extendable, cross-platform Swift IDE with good
refactoring tools. Since Xcode is heavily focused on the development of iOS and Mac apps, Tifig may
primarly appeal to web developers who want to use Swift on the server.

I am working on Tifig as part of my master thesis at [HSR](http://www.hsr.ch), where I also have a part-time job
at the [Institute for Software](http://ifs.hsr.ch/). where we make [Cevelop](https://www.cevelop.com) among other things.

You are welcome to download Tifig and try it on your system. Any feedback is highly appreciated. You can send me an [email](mailto:tonisuter@me.com)
or a DM on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tonisuter). Please keep in mind however, that Tifig is in a very early in the development stage and a lot of essential
features are still missing or incomplete.
